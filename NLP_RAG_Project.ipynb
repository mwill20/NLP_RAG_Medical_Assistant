        "* **Embedded Example (One-Shot Learning):** The `<example>` block is the most significant enhancement. It provides a perfect demonstration of the desired output, including the exact citation format (`[Page: X]`) and professional tone. Showing the model what to do is far more effective than just describing it.\n",
        "\n",

            "The protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit involves rapid empiric antibiotic therapy, general supportive measures, and later adjusting antibiotics according to sensitivities and the site of infection. If bacterial cultures show no growth by 48 hours and the neonate appears well, antibiotics are stopped [Page: 1182]. General supportive measures include respiratory and hemodynamic management [Page: 1182]. Antibiotic selection requires an educated guess based on the suspected source, clinical setting, knowledge or suspicion of causative organisms and of sensitivity patterns common to that specific inpatient unit, and previous culture results [Page: 2456]. Commonly used antibiotics include gentamicin or tobramycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), ceftazidime plus a fluoroquinolone, or monotherapy with maximal therapeutic doses of ceftazidime or imipenem [Page: 2456]. Vancomycin must be added if resistant staphylococci or enterococci are suspected, and a drug effective against anaerobes should be included if there is an abdominal source [Page: 1182]. Abscesses must be drained, and necrotic tissues must be surgically excised to eliminate septic foci [Page: 1182]. Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome in critically ill patients, even those not known to be diabetic, by maintaining it between 80 to 110 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L) with a continuous IV insulin infusion [Page: 2995].\n"

            "2. Definitive treatment, such as reduction, may be required and usually involves analgesia or sedation [Page: 3390]. Closed reduction is maintained by casting, while open reduction is maintained by various surgical hardware like pins, screws, plates, or external fixators [Page: 3390].\n",
            "3. RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) therapy should be applied to soft-tissue injuries for faster healing and pain relief [Page: 3377].\n",
            "4. For patients with a lower-limb prosthesis, maintaining body alignment is crucial, but even with a good fit, skin breakdown can occur due to ongoing changes in the stump's size [Page: 3646]. In such cases, patients should promptly see a healthcare practitioner and a prosthetist for adjustments.\n",
            "5. Rehabilitation is started as soon as possible after hip fracture surgery, focusing on increasing strength and preventing atrophy on the unaffected side [Page: 3646]. Gradual mobilization of the affected limb usually results in full ambulation.\n",
            "6. Patients should avoid activities like prolonged lifting or pushing of heavy items, stooping, reaching, or jumping during ambulation to minimize mechanical stress [Page: 3646].\n",
            "7. Wounds near joints should be immobilized with splints and kept clean and dry to prevent infection and promote healing [Page: 3386].\n",
            "8. Antibiotics may be given as early as possible for infected wounds, and wounds are usually immobilized to minimize movement that could interfere with healing [Page: 3386].\n",
            "9. Patients should wear appropriate orthotic protection or shoes after ulcers have healed to prevent further injury [Page: 1023].\n",

Hormonal modulators such as oral contraceptives or spironolactone may be useful for female-pattern hair loss associated with hyperandrogenemia [Page: 858]. The underlying cause of alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disorder affecting genetically susceptible people exposed to unclear environmental triggers [Page: 858]. Other possible causes of sudden patchy hair loss include infection, drugs (including chemotherapeutic agents), and systemic illnesses [Page: 856]. A thorough evaluation including a history, physical examination, and possibly microscopic hair examination or scalp biopsy may be required for definitive diagnosis [Page: 857-858].\n"

        "      This project proves that the RAG architecture is highly effective for converting dense, domain-specific documents like the Merck Manual into an interactive, accurate, and verifiable question-answering system. The final RAG responses were consistently superior to the base LLM's generic knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Advanced Prompting is Key to Safe and Effective Use:**\n",
        "\n",
        "      The implementation of a structured XML prompt with explicit rules was the most critical factor in controlling the model's behavior. This allowed us to enforce mandatory source citation and to make the model safely refuse to answer when the context was insufficient—a non-negotiable feature for a medical application.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Pipeline Tuning is a Balancing Act:**\n",
        "\n",
        "      The fine-tuning experiment showed that RAG performance is a system of trade-offs. Changing the chunk_size directly impacts the context quality. Larger chunks can provide more comprehensive answers but may reduce retrieval precision. The optimal configuration is not universal and must be tuned based on the document's structure and expected user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Context Window Management can be an Engineering Hurdle:**\n",
        "\n",
        "      The context window overflow error was encountered initially during the evaluation phase which is a primary practical challenge in building RAG systems. It highlights that the entire pipeline, from the number of documents retrieved (k) to the length of the prompts, must be managed. Implementing robust strategies like context truncation is essential for system stability.\n",

We recommend developing a user interface that displays the generated answer alongside the retrieved context snippets.

When a new edition of the Merck Manual (or other source material) is released, the data preparation pipeline (chunking, embedding, and vector store creation) must be re-run to ensure the AI assistant is always providing the most current medical information.\n",
